# Mal interpreter

This directory includes a copy of the code of the Ruby implementation of Mal
interpreter written by Joel Martin. It is copied from the [`ruby` directory of
the Mal project](https://github.com/kanaka/mal/tree/master/ruby).  It is used
for easy bootstrapping of malc.

You can use any other Mal interepreter by setting the `MAL_IMPL` environment
variable during bootstrap.
